# Neutron Stars — Specializatoin Project (TFY4510)

This repository contains the LaTeX source and numerical material for my 
project in the course **TFY4510 – Physics Specialization Project**
at NTNU. The project focuses on the theoretical modelling of neutron
stars, with emphasis on the equation of state of dense matter, the
Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations, and the resulting mass–radius
relations.

The project combines analytical results, numerical solutions of the TOV
equations, and comparisons with current observational constraints from
radio pulsar timing, NICER X-ray observations, and gravitational-wave
measurements.

## Contents

- Full LaTeX source for the written project.
- Automated PDF build via GitHub Actions.
- Python code used to generate figures and numerical results included in
  the main text.
