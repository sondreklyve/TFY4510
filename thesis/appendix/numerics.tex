\chapter{Numerical Implementation and Code Availability}
\label{app:code}

All numerical results presented in the text were produced using
custom Python code developed for this project.
The implementation covers the construction of equations of state,
solutions of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, stability
analysis of radial oscillations, and post-processing for comparison
with observational constraints.

Due to the size and complexity of the codebase, the full source code
is not reproduced in this text. Instead, the complete implementation
is made available in a public version-controlled repository:
\url{https://github.com/sondreklyve/TFY4510}.

The numerical code is structured into modules corresponding to the
different physical models discussed in the text, including ideal
Fermi gas models, incompressible stars, idealized neutron stars, and
$npe\mu$ matter described within a relativistic mean-field framework.
All figures appearing in the text are produced using this code, either
from data generated by the implementation or from externally provided datasets.

Most of the numerical implementation is adapted from existing
academic work. In particular, the $npe\mu$ relativistic mean-field
solver is based on code developed by Pogliano \cite{pogliano2017},
and the ideal neutron star and radial stability analysis builds on work by Sletmoen \cite{sletmoen2022}.
These components have been refactored,
extended, and integrated into a unified framework for the present
project. Full attribution and links to the original sources are
provided in the repository documentation.
