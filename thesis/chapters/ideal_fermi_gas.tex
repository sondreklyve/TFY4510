\section{Introduction}

The central microscopic mechanism that allows compact stars to resist gravitational collapse
is the Pauli exclusion principle, which forbids fermions from occupying the same quantum state.
Even in the absence of thermal motion, a collection of fermions must successively fill momentum
states, starting from the lowest energy and extending up to a sharp cutoff. This cutoff is
characterized by the \emph{Fermi momentum} $p_F$, the largest momentum occupied in the ground
state of the system, and the associated \emph{Fermi energy} $E_F$, the energy of the highest
occupied single--particle state. The resulting degeneracy pressure, which arises entirely from the
quantum mechanical exclusion principle rather than from thermal motion, provides the dominant
contribution to the internal support of dense stellar matter. 

The simplest theoretical description of such systems is the \emph{ideal, zero--temperature Fermi
gas}. In this model, fermions are treated as non--interacting particles that occupy all quantum
states inside a sphere of radius $p_F$ in momentum space, known as the \emph{Fermi surface}.
Despite its simplicity, the ideal Fermi gas captures the essential qualitative physics of compact
stars~\cite{pathria2011}. For instance, the equilibrium of white dwarfs can be described by the
degeneracy pressure of electrons. For lighter white dwarfs the electrons are mostly
non--relativistic, while in more massive white dwarfs the electrons at the Fermi surface become
relativistic. In this high--density regime the model predicts the existence of a maximum stable
mass, the Chandrasekhar limit~\cite{chandrasekhar1931,chandrasekhar1935,shapiro1983}. Likewise,
an \emph{ideal neutron gas} provided the basis of the pioneering Oppenheimer--Volkoff study of
neutron stars~\cite{oppenheimer1939}.

From the perspective of general relativity, the ideal Fermi gas plays a crucial role as it provides
an explicit equation of state, $P = P(\epsilon)$, which closes the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff
equations derived in the previous chapter. While real neutron star matter is far more complicated,
involving strong nuclear interactions, finite temperatures, and possibly exotic components, the ideal Fermi gas remains a natural starting point. It offers both
analytic insight in certain limits and a benchmark against which more sophisticated models can be
compared.

The purpose of this chapter is therefore twofold: first, to review the theoretical foundations of
an ideal Fermi gas at zero temperature, deriving expressions for number density, energy density,
pressure, and chemical potential; and second, to connect these results to the astrophysical
context of compact stars. We emphasize the non--relativistic and ultra--relativistic limits, where
the expressions simplify considerably and provide physical intuition. Finally, we will discuss how
the ideal Fermi gas equation of state can be coupled to the TOV equations to describe equilibrium
configurations of idealized neutron stars.

\section{Quantum statistics at zero temperature}

Fermions are particles with half--integer spin that obey the Pauli exclusion principle: 
no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. 
The statistical distribution that incorporates this principle is the Fermi--Dirac distribution,
\begin{equation}
f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E-\mu)/T}+1},
\label{eq:fermi_dirac_distribution}
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the single--particle energy, $\mu$ the chemical potential, 
and $T$ the temperature (in natural units $k_B=1$).  

In the zero--temperature limit $T\to 0$, the distribution becomes a sharp step function,
\begin{equation}
f(E) = \Theta(\mu - E),
\label{eq:zeroT_distribution}
\end{equation}
so that all states with $E<\mu$ are occupied and all states with $E>\mu$ are empty.  
At $T=0$, the chemical potential takes the value
\begin{equation}
E_F = \mu(T=0),
\end{equation}
which is called the \emph{Fermi energy}. It is the energy of the highest occupied 
single--particle state in the system.  

\begin{figure}[ht]

so that all states with $E<\mu$ are occupied and all higher states are empty. 
Increasing temperature smooths the step around the Fermi energy.}
\label{fig:fermi_dirac_distribution}
\end{figure}

From the special--relativistic dispersion relation
\begin{equation}
E(p) = \sqrt{p^2+m^2},
\label{eq:SR_dispersion}
\end{equation}
with $m$ the particle rest mass and $p=|\vec{p}|$ the momentum magnitude, one obtains at $T=0$ 
\begin{equation}
p_F = \sqrt{\mu^2 - m^2},
\end{equation}
since $\mu = E_F$ in this limit.  

Thus a degenerate Fermi gas is fully specified once the particle mass $m$ and the chemical potential $\mu$ are given. 
Equivalently, one can use the pair $(m, p_F)$, since $p_F$ and $\mu$ are related by the dispersion relation above. 
These quantities set the natural scales of the system and will serve as the basis for the thermodynamic description in the following sections.

\subsection*{Physical meaning of $E_F$ and $p_F$}
The Fermi energy $E_F$ measures the energy cost of adding one more particle to the system at zero
temperature, since all lower--energy states are already occupied. The Fermi momentum $p_F$ is
therefore the largest momentum carried by any fermion in the ground state. Together they define
the ``surface'' of occupied states in momentum space --- the Fermi surface --- which plays a central
role in both condensed matter and astrophysical systems. Even at $T=0$, fermions cannot all sit in
the lowest momentum state; instead, the exclusion principle forces them to occupy an entire sphere
of states up to $p_F$. This filling of states gives rise to degeneracy pressure, independent of
temperature.


\section{Thermodynamics of an ideal Fermi gas}
\label{sec:thermo_ideal_fermi}

Having reviewed the statistical foundations and the concepts of Fermi energy and Fermi
momentum, we now derive the thermodynamic quantities of a degenerate Fermi gas at zero
temperature by integrating over occupied momentum states up to $p_F$. The momentum--space
volume element is $d^3p=4\pi p^2\,dp$, and the density of states per unit volume is
$\tfrac{g}{(2\pi)^3}\,d^3p$, where $g=2s+1$ accounts for spin degeneracy. The following expressions are
standard and can be found in e.g. Shapiro \& Teukolsky or Carroll~\cite{shapiro1983,carroll}.

\subsection*{Number density}
The \emph{number density} $n$ denotes the number of particles per unit volume in the fluid
rest frame ($n \equiv N/V$). At zero temperature it is determined by how many
single--particle momentum states are filled up to the Fermi momentum $p_F$.
Because of the Pauli principle, each momentum state can be occupied by several fermions
that differ only in internal quantum numbers. For a particle of spin $s$, the available spin
projections $m_s=-s,-s+1,\dots,s$ give a total \emph{degeneracy}
\begin{equation}
g \;=\; 2s+1.
\end{equation}
Thus, each momentum state admits up to $g$ fermions. For spin-$\tfrac12$ particles
such as electrons, neutrons, or protons one has $g=2$.

Counting the total number of occupied states inside the Fermi sphere then gives
\begin{equation}
n \;=\; g \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,\Theta(p_F-|\vec p|)
\;=\; \frac{g}{2\pi^2}\int_0^{p_F}p^2\,dp
\;=\; \frac{g}{6\pi^2}\,p_F^{3}.
\label{eq:fermi_number_density}
\end{equation}
This fundamental relation fixes the Fermi momentum in terms of $n$,
\begin{equation}
p_F \;=\; \Big(\tfrac{6\pi^2}{g}\,n\Big)^{1/3},
\label{eq:pF_of_n}
\end{equation}
and connects the microscopic filling of momentum states to the macroscopic particle density.

\subsection*{Energy density}
The total energy density follows from summing the single--particle energies $E(p)=\sqrt{p^2+m^2}$ 
over all occupied momentum states. In terms of the general phase--space integral,
\begin{equation}
\epsilon \;=\; g \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,E(p)\,\Theta(p_F-|\vec p|)
\;=\; \frac{g}{2\pi^2}\int_0^{p_F}\sqrt{p^2+m^2}\,p^2\,dp.
\label{eq:energy_density_integral}
\end{equation}
To simplify the evaluation it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variable $x=p/m$, 
with upper limit $x_F=p_F/m$, so that
\begin{equation}
\epsilon \;=\; \frac{g\,m^4}{2\pi^2}\int_0^{x_F}\!\sqrt{1+x^2}\,x^2\,dx.
\end{equation}
Carrying out the integral yields the compact analytic form
\begin{equation}
\epsilon \;=\; \frac{g\,m^4}{16\pi^2}
\Big[\,x_F\sqrt{1+x_F^2}\,(2x_F^2+1)\;-\;\sinh^{-1}x_F\,\Big].
\label{eq:energy_density}
\end{equation}
This expression makes explicit the crossover between the non--relativistic regime 
($x_F\ll 1$, where $\epsilon \approx m n$ with small kinetic corrections) 
and the ultra--relativistic regime ($x_F\gg 1$, where $\epsilon \propto p_F^4$).

\subsection*{Chemical potential}
The chemical potential measures the change in energy when adding one particle to the system, 
and at zero temperature it coincides with the Fermi energy. 
Intuitively, this is because the highest occupied single--particle state at $T=0$ 
sits exactly at the Fermi surface, so adding one more fermion forces it into that state. 
Formally, one finds
\begin{equation}
\mu \;=\; E_F \;=\; \sqrt{p_F^2+m^2}
\;=\; m\,\sqrt{1+x_F^2}
\;=\; \sqrt{\,m^2 + \Big(\tfrac{6\pi^2}{g}\,n\Big)^{2/3}\,},
\label{eq:mu_zeroT}
\end{equation}
where the last equality follows from the relation between Fermi momentum and number density, 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:pF_of_n}.

Two useful thermodynamic identities hold in the degenerate limit $T=0$: 
\begin{equation}
d\epsilon \;=\; \mu\,dn,
\qquad
\epsilon + P \;=\; \mu\,n.
\label{eq:zeroT_identities}
\end{equation}
The first expresses that the chemical potential is the derivative of the energy density 
with respect to particle number, while the second is the Gibbs--Duhem relation
with the entropy term $Ts$ vanishing at zero temperature. 
These relations are easily checked by differentiating the explicit integral expressions 
for $\epsilon$ and $n$: from \eqref{eq:energy_density_integral} and \eqref{eq:fermi_number_density} one finds
\[
\mu \;=\; \frac{d\epsilon}{dn} \;=\; \sqrt{p_F^2+m^2},
\]
which confirms Eq.~\eqref{eq:mu_zeroT}.

\subsection*{Pressure}
Microscopically, pressure can be defined as the flux of momentum carried by the particles across a unit area. 
In relativistic kinetic theory this notion is captured by the spatial diagonal components of the energy--momentum tensor,
\begin{equation}
T^{\mu\nu} \;=\; g \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,\frac{p^\mu p^\nu}{E(p)}\,f(p),
\end{equation}
with $E(p)=\sqrt{p^2+m^2}$ and $f(p)$ the occupation number. 
At zero temperature, the distribution is simply a step function $f(p)=\Theta(p_F-p)$, filling all states up to the Fermi momentum. 
The pressure is then given by the diagonal spatial component, for instance $T^{xx}$,
\begin{equation}
P \;=\; T^{xx} \;=\; g \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,\frac{p_x^2}{E(p)}\,f(p).
\end{equation}
Because the Fermi sphere is isotropic, the average over directions yields $\langle p_x^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{3}p^2$, so that
\begin{equation}
P \;=\; \frac{g}{3}\int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,\frac{p^2}{E(p)}\,f(p).
\end{equation}
Switching to spherical momentum coordinates, $d^3p=4\pi p^2 dp$, gives the momentum--flux integral
\begin{equation}
P \;=\; \frac{g}{6\pi^2}\int_0^{p_F}\frac{p^4}{\sqrt{p^2+m^2}}\,dp
\;=\; \frac{g\,m^4}{6\pi^2}\int_0^{x_F}\frac{x^4}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\,dx,
\label{eq:pressure_integral}
\end{equation}
which evaluates to
\begin{equation}
P \;=\; \frac{g\,m^4}{48\pi^2}
\Big[\,x_F\sqrt{1+x_F^2}\,(2x_F^2-3)\;+\;3\,\sinh^{-1}x_F\,\Big].
\label{eq:pressure}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Alternatively, the pressure can also be obtained from the thermodynamic relation
\begin{equation}
P \;=\; -\,\epsilon \;+\; \mu n,
\end{equation}
which follows from the Gibbs--Duhem relation introduced in the previous section. 
This provides a useful check on the explicit momentum--flux calculation above.

\section{Equation of State and Limiting Cases}

The expressions derived above provide $n$, $\epsilon$ and $P$ as explicit functions of the
Fermi momentum $p_F$ (or equivalently the dimensionless ratio $x_F=p_F/m$). In practice,
this means that the ideal Fermi gas equation of state is most conveniently written in
\emph{parametric form}:
\begin{align}
\epsilon &= \epsilon(x_F), \\
P &= P(x_F),
\end{align}
with $\epsilon(x_F)$ and $P(x_F)$ given by
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:energy_density} and \eqref{eq:pressure}. The chemical potential
is simultaneously determined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:mu_zeroT}. Eliminating $x_F$ gives a
closed functional relation $P(\epsilon)$, but the analytic form is not especially
transparent; in astrophysical applications one typically evaluates the parametric
expressions numerically.

Nevertheless, in the two limiting regimes $p_F \ll m$ (non--relativistic) and
$p_F \gg m$ (ultra--relativistic), the integrals admit simple expansions that are
physically illuminating.

\subsection*{Non--relativistic limit}
In the non--relativistic regime $x_F=p_F/m\ll 1$, single--particle energies are
$E(p)\simeq m+\frac{p^2}{2m}$. The pressure and number density at $T=0$ are
\begin{equation}
P \;\simeq\; \frac{g}{30\pi^2\,m}\,p_F^5,
\qquad
n \;=\; \frac{g}{6\pi^2}\,p_F^3.
\label{eq:NR_p_and_n}
\end{equation}
In this limit the \emph{total} energy density is dominated by rest mass,
\begin{equation}
\epsilon \;\simeq\; m\,n,
\label{eq:NR_eps_total}
\end{equation}
with a subleading kinetic piece (of order $p_F^5/m$) that we neglect when relating
$\epsilon$ to $P$. Eliminating $p_F$ between \eqref{eq:NR_p_and_n} gives
\[
p_F^5 \;=\; \frac{30\pi^2\,m}{g}\,P,
\qquad
p_F^3 \;=\; \biggl(\frac{30\pi^2\,m}{g}\,P\biggr)^{\!3/5}.
\]
Hence
\begin{align}
n \;&=\; \frac{g}{6\pi^2}\,p_F^3
\;=\; \frac{g}{6\pi^2}\,\biggl(\frac{30\pi^2\,m}{g}\,P\biggr)^{\!3/5},
\\[2pt]
\epsilon(P) \;&=\; m\,n
\;=\; \Bigl(\tfrac{30^{3/5}}{6}\,\pi^{-4/5}\Bigr)\,
g^{2/5}\,m^{8/5}\,P^{3/5}.
\end{align}
Thus, in the non--relativistic limit the equation of state exhibits the polytropic scaling
\begin{equation}
\epsilon \;\propto\; P^{3/5}.
\end{equation}
The term ``polytropic'' refers to an equation of state of the form 
$P = K \rho^\gamma$, where $\rho$ is the mass density. 
At zero temperature in the non--relativistic regime the energy density is dominated 
by rest mass, $\epsilon \simeq m n \simeq \rho$, so that the relation above is 
equivalent to $P \propto \rho^{5/3}$. The effective polytropic index is therefore 
$\gamma = 5/3$ for a non--relativistic degenerate Fermi gas.

\subsection*{Ultra--relativistic limit}
For large Fermi momenta, $x_F \gg 1$, the rest mass becomes negligible and
$E(p) \approx p$. The integrals then yield
\begin{align}
\epsilon &\;\approx\; \frac{g}{8\pi^2}\,p_F^4, \\
P &\;\approx\; \frac{g}{24\pi^2}\,p_F^4,
\end{align}
so that the equation of state approaches
\begin{equation}
\epsilon \;=\; 3\, P.
\label{eq:ultrarel_eos}
\end{equation}
This is identical to the relation for a gas of massless particles such as
photons or neutrinos, consistent with the fact that for $P \gg m$ the particle
dispersion relation becomes effectively massless.

\subsection*{Physical interpretation}
The two limiting behaviors highlight the changing \emph{stiffness} of the Fermi gas
equation of state, i.e.\ how strongly the pressure responds to increasing energy density. 
In the non--relativistic regime, the pressure scales as $n^{5/3}$, which rises faster 
than linearly with density but remains subdominant to the rest--mass energy in $\epsilon$. 
In contrast, in the ultra--relativistic regime the pressure is a fixed fraction ($1/3$) 
of the energy density, producing a much softer relation between $P$ and $\epsilon$. 
The transition between these two regimes occurs when $p_F \sim m$, i.e.\ when
the typical fermion momentum becomes comparable to the rest mass. 
In compact stars, electrons often approach or enter the relativistic regime at 
sufficiently high densities, while baryons such as neutrons may remain largely 
non--relativistic in lighter stars but become increasingly relativistic as central 
densities grow. In all cases, the degeneracy pressure encapsulated by the Fermi gas 
equation of state provides the fundamental microscopic mechanism preventing 
gravitational collapse.

\section{Astrophysical Relevance}

The ideal Fermi gas model, while highly simplified, captures the essential
microscopic mechanism that allows compact stars to resist gravitational
collapse: degeneracy pressure. Its relevance can be illustrated in two
canonical astrophysical contexts.

\paragraph{White dwarfs.}
In white dwarfs, the pressure support is provided almost entirely by
degenerate electrons. As the central density increases, the electron
Fermi momentum can approach or exceed the rest mass, $p_F \gtrsim m_e$,
driving the system toward the relativistic regime. In this limit the
equation of state approaches $P = \epsilon/3$, and the stellar mass
becomes essentially independent of radius. Balancing this relativistic
degeneracy pressure against gravity yields the Chandrasekhar mass limit,
$M_{\rm Ch} \simeq 1.4\,M_\odot$. This result follows under the
idealized assumptions of a cold, non--interacting electron gas providing
all of the pressure support, with ions contributing only to the rest--mass
density, and with the electrons treated in the ultra--relativistic
limit. Despite these simplifications, the Chandrasekhar limit gives a
value close to the maximum masses of observed white dwarfs, making the
ideal Fermi gas a useful model for this calculation.

\paragraph{Neutron stars.}
In their pioneering work, Oppenheimer and Volkoff modeled neutron stars
as a cold, ideal Fermi gas of neutrons with no nuclear interactions,
described by the full relativistic dispersion relation
$E(p)=\sqrt{p^2+m_n^2}$. Solving the TOV equations with this equation of
state, they found a maximum stable mass of order $0.7\,M_\odot$. Although
this value is far below the $\sim 2\,M_\odot$ neutron stars observed
today~\cite{haensel2007}, the calculation was historically crucial: it
demonstrated that combining general relativity with a microscopic
equation of state leads to an upper mass limit for neutron stars,
analogous to Chandrasekhar’s result for white dwarfs.

\paragraph{Limitations.}
The ideal Fermi gas neglects several important physical ingredients. Real
neutron star matter is strongly interacting, with short--range nuclear
forces significantly modifying the pressure at supranuclear densities.
Charge neutrality and beta equilibrium imply a mixture of neutrons,
protons, electrons, and muons, rather than a pure single--species Fermi
gas. At sufficiently high densities, more exotic components may appear.
Moreover, finite temperature effects can be relevant in newly born
protoneutron stars. All of these factors alter the equation of state,
and hence the predicted stellar structure.

\paragraph{Summary.}
Despite its limitations, the ideal Fermi gas remains a valuable baseline
model. It provides analytic control in limiting regimes, a clear physical
picture of degeneracy pressure, and a simple parametric equation of state
that can be directly coupled to the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations.
As such, it serves as a pedagogical introduction to compact star physics,
and its predictions---such as the Chandrasekhar mass for white dwarfs and
the Oppenheimer--Volkoff mass limit for neutron stars---show that even this
simplified treatment can reproduce the correct order of magnitude for the
maximum masses of compact stars.
