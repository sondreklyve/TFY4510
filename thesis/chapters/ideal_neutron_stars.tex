\chapter{Ideal Neutron Stars}
\label{chap:ideal_neutron_stars}

\section{Introduction}

The concept of an \emph{ideal neutron star} provides a minimal
theoretical model for a relativistic compact star.
Here the term ``ideal'' refers to the use of a simple, non--interacting
Fermi gas equation of state, representing matter at zero temperature.
The composition is taken to be pure neutrons for simplicity,
in analogy with the classic white dwarf model where support against
gravity arises from electron degeneracy pressure.
The key distinction is that neutron stars reach densities so high
that the gravitational field itself becomes extremely strong,
requiring a treatment within general relativity.
The appropriate framework is therefore given by the TOV equations
introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:tov}.

To close the TOV system, an EOS relating pressure $P$ and energy density
$\epsilon$ must be specified.
Here we adopt the ideal Fermi gas EOS developed in
Chapter~\ref{chap:fermi}, specialized to neutrons of mass $m_{n}$.
Substituting this EOS into the TOV equations yields a complete system
that can be solved numerically.

The aim of this chapter is therefore to construct and analyze such ideal neutron
star models, with the focus on the numerical implementation and results.

\section{Numerical Setup}

The TOV equations derived in Chapter~\ref{chap:tov} describe the
radial dependence of the pressure $P(r)$ and enclosed mass $m(r)$ in a
static, spherically symmetric star. To integrate these equations we
must specify the boundary conditions. They are
\[
m(0)=0, \qquad P(0)=P_c, \qquad P(R)=0,
\]
where $P_c$ is the central pressure and $R$ is the stellar radius at
which the pressure vanishes. The corresponding gravitational mass is
then $M=m(R)$.

In Chapter~\ref{chap:fermi} we obtained this relation for a degenerate,
zero--temperature Fermi gas. Specializing to neutrons of mass $m_N$,
the EOS can be expressed in parametric form
\[
P = P(x_F), \qquad \epsilon = \epsilon(x_F),
\]
with $x_F=p_F/m_N$ the dimensionless Fermi momentum.
Although this parametric representation is convenient analytically,
the numerical solver expects $\epsilon(P)$. We therefore invert
$P(x_F)$ numerically to obtain $x_F(P)$, and then evaluate
$\epsilon(x_F)$ accordingly. This guarantees a consistent mapping
between $P$ and $\epsilon$ across all density regimes.

For numerical stability it is advantageous to work with dimensionless
variables. We introduce reference scales for radius, mass, and energy
density,
\[
r_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G \epsilon_0}}, \qquad
m_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G^3 \epsilon_0}}, \qquad
\epsilon_0 = m_N^4.
\]
All quantities are then expressed in units of $(r_0, m_0, \epsilon_0)$,
so that
\[
\hat r = r/r_0, \qquad
\hat m = m/m_0, \qquad
\hat P = P/\epsilon_0, \qquad
\hat \epsilon = \epsilon/\epsilon_0.
\]
In terms of these variables the TOV system takes a dimensionless form
suitable for numerical integration. This rescaling avoids very large
or small floating--point numbers and improves the stability of the
Runge--Kutta solver.

In summary, the numerical setup consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The TOV equations, integrated outward from the center with 
  initial conditions $m(0)=0$ and $P(0)=P_c$, and terminated when 
  the surface condition $P(R)=0$ is reached. The corresponding 
  radius $R$ and gravitational mass $M=m(R)$ then characterize 
  the stellar model.
  \item The ideal neutron gas EOS $\epsilon(P)$, obtained from the
  parametric Fermi gas expressions of Chapter~\ref{chap:fermi}.
  \item Dimensionless variables to reduce numerical instabilities.
\end{enumerate}
Together these ingredients define a well--posed system suitable for
numerical solution.

\section{Numerical Method}

The numerical integration of the TOV equations with the ideal neutron
gas EOS is carried out using a Python program originally developed by
Sletmoen as part of his Master's thesis~\cite{sletmoen2022}.
In this work the code is used without modification to generate stellar
models for the case of ideal neutron matter.

The implementation proceeds as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The coupled ODEs for $P(r)$ and $m(r)$ are integrated outward
  from $r=0$ with initial values $P(0)=P_c$ and $m(0)=0$.
  \item A Runge--Kutta algorithm with adaptive step size is used to
  advance the solution.
  \item The integration terminates once $P(r)$ vanishes, which defines
  the stellar radius $R$. The corresponding $m(R)$ gives the
  gravitational mass $M$.
\end{itemize}
Repeating the calculation for a range of central pressures $P_c$
generates a sequence of stellar configurations. From these solutions
one can extract the global properties of the star --- quantities defined
at the surface that characterize the star as a whole --- namely its mass
$M=m(R)$ and radius $R$ where $P(R)=0$. These global results can then be
combined into the mass--radius relation. In addition, the solver also
provides access to the internal structure, meaning the radial profiles
of pressure $P(r)$ and energy density $\epsilon(r)$ throughout the
stellar interior. Such internal results reveal how matter is distributed
and how pressure balances gravity at each radius, complementing the
global description. In the following section we present both global and
internal results for ideal neutron stars.


\section{Results}

The numerical integration of the TOV equations using the ideal neutron
gas EOS yields both global properties, such as the mass--radius relation,
and internal structure, such as the pressure distribution.
These results can be directly compared with the analytic behavior found
for the uniform--density star in Chapter~\ref{chap:tov}.

\subsection*{Mass--radius relation}

Figure~\ref{fig:mr_neutron} shows the resulting mass--radius curves for
ideal neutron stars.  The four models represent combinations of
Newtonian and relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium with either the
non--relativistic or the full relativistic form of the Fermi gas EOS.
Each point corresponds to a distinct central pressure $P_c$.

At low central pressures the models coincide, reflecting the Newtonian
limit where gravitational fields are weak and the EOS is nearly
non--relativistic.  As $P_c$ increases, however, the relativistic models
deviate markedly: the curves flatten and eventually exhibit a turnover,
indicating that beyond a certain maximum mass, no further stable
solutions exist.  This behavior is the relativistic analogue of the
instability already encountered in the incompressible model, where the
pressure diverges at the Buchdahl bound $2M/R=8/9$.  In a realistic
neutron gas, the same effect manifests itself as the \emph{Oppenheimer--Volkoff
limit}~\cite{oppenheimer1939}: a maximum gravitational mass of order
$M_{\mathrm{max}}\!\approx\!0.7\,M_{\odot}$ for an ideal, non--interacting
neutron fluid.  Beyond this point, increasing the central pressure only
reduces the radius without adding mass, and the configuration becomes
unstable to collapse.

The Newtonian solutions, in contrast, show no turnover.  They predict
monotonically increasing mass with increasing central pressure, an
artifact of neglecting relativistic corrections to both gravity and the
EOS.  The fully relativistic treatment thus captures a key qualitative
feature: the existence of a maximum stable mass set by the balance
between degeneracy pressure and spacetime curvature.

  indicates the central pressure $P_c$.  The relativistic models exhibit a
  maximum mass, the Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit, beyond which no static
  equilibrium is possible.}
  \label{fig:mr_neutron}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Pressure profiles}

Figure~\ref{fig:profiles_neutron} displays the normalized pressure
profiles $P(r)/P_c$ for a range of central pressures.
For small $P_c$, the pressure decreases almost linearly with radius,
resembling the Newtonian incompressible case.
As $P_c$ increases, the curves become increasingly concentrated toward
the center, revealing stronger gravitational compression and greater
compactness.  The outer layers contribute less to the total mass, while
the interior supports an ever larger fraction of the gravitational
weight.  This mirrors the analytic results for the constant--density
star, where high compactness led to steep gradients and eventual
divergence at the Buchdahl bound.

At the highest central pressures, the pressure gradient near the center
becomes extremely steep, signaling the proximity of the
Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit.  Beyond this limit, no equilibrium solution
exists: the star must collapse into a black hole.  Thus, the numerical
pressure profiles confirm the same qualitative physics inferred from the
analytic model—namely, that gravity strengthens faster than the pressure
support as compactness increases.

  the approach to the Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit.}

\section{Radial stability analysis}
\label{sec:ideal_ns_stability}

\subsection{Physical motivation}

The mass--radius curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:mr_neutron} show that the
relativistic models reach a maximum mass and then turn over.
This turning point marks a change in stability. 
To understand why this happens, we study how small radial
perturbations behave in a star that is initially in hydrostatic
equilibrium.

If the star is slightly compressed, gravity and pressure respond in
opposite directions: gravity pulls matter inward while pressure pushes
it outward. 
If the pressure increase is strong enough to balance the added gravity,
the star will oscillate around its equilibrium shape and remain stable.
If gravity grows faster than the pressure response, the perturbation
will instead amplify with time and lead to collapse.

\subsection{Linearized equations}

A convenient way to study the stability of a relativistic star is to
examine how it responds to small, time--dependent, radial perturbations.
The stability problem was first solved in detail by
Chandrasekhar~\cite{chandrasekhar1964}, who derived the full set of
relativistic perturbation equations for a fluid sphere.
In this work we follow the later formulation of
Tooper~\cite{tooper1965}, which rewrites the equations in a form that is
more convenient for numerical integration and directly leads to the
Sturm--Liouville equation for the radial modes.

In this approach, one introduces a small radial displacement
$\xi(r,t)$ of the fluid layers and linearizes the Einstein and fluid
equations to first order in the perturbation amplitude.
The resulting system can be combined into a single
second--order differential equation for a variable $U(r,t)$ that is
proportional to $\xi(r,t)$.
Assuming harmonic time dependence $U(r,t)=U(r)\,e^{i\omega t}$ gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dr}\!\left[\Pi(r)\frac{dU}{dr}\right]
+ Q(r)\,U(r) + \omega^2 W(r)\,U(r) = 0,
\label{eq:SL_ideal_NS}
\end{equation}
which has the standard form of a \emph{Sturm--Liouville eigenvalue
problem}. The quantity $\omega^2$ is the squared oscillation frequency.

A Sturm--Liouville problem is a general class of second--order linear
differential equations with specific boundary conditions that admit a
discrete set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
Each allowed solution $U_n(r)$ corresponds to an \emph{eigenmode}, and
the associated constant $\omega_n^2$ is its \emph{eigenvalue}.
In the context of stellar oscillations, $\omega_n^2$ represents the
squared frequency of the $n$th radial mode.
If all eigenvalues are positive, the star performs stable oscillations.
When the lowest eigenvalue $\omega_0^2$ becomes zero or negative, the
oscillation changes into a growing mode, and the equilibrium becomes
dynamically unstable~\cite{arfken2013}.

The coefficients $\Pi(r)$, $Q(r)$, and $W(r)$ depend only on the
background stellar structure, that is, on $P(r)$, $\epsilon(r)$,
$m(r)$, and the metric potential $\alpha(r)$ obtained from the TOV
equations.
They also include the adiabatic index
\[
\Gamma_1(r) = \frac{\epsilon(r)+P(r)}{P(r)}
\frac{dP}{d\epsilon}\bigg|_{r},
\]
which describes the local stiffness of the equation of state.

Regularity at the center requires $U(r)\propto r^{3}$ as $r\to0$.
At the surface $r=R$, the pressure must vanish smoothly, giving the
boundary condition $\Delta P(R)=0$ for the Lagrangian pressure
perturbation.
With these two boundary conditions, the problem is well defined and can
be solved for the eigenvalues $\omega^2$.

\subsection{Numerical method}

Equation~\eqref{eq:SL_ideal_NS} forms an eigenvalue problem for the
frequency $\omega^2$. For each stellar model obtained from the TOV
equations, we can calculate the background functions
$P(r)$, $\epsilon(r)$, $m(r)$, and $\alpha(r)$, and from them construct
the coefficients $\Pi(r)$, $Q(r)$, and $W(r)$.
These three functions contain all the information about the background
structure and determine how the star responds to small radial motions.
They are given by~\cite{tooper1965}
\[
\Pi = e^{\beta+3\alpha}\frac{\Gamma_1 P}{r^2}, \qquad
Q = e^{\beta+3\alpha}\!\left(
  \frac{dP}{dr}\frac{d\alpha}{dr}
  - \frac{4}{r}\frac{dP}{dr}
  - 8\pi G e^{2\beta} P(\epsilon + P)
\right), \qquad
W = e^{3\beta+\alpha}\frac{\epsilon+P}{r^2}.
\]
where $\alpha(r)$ and $\beta(r)$ are the metric functions,
$\Gamma_1$ is the adiabatic index defined in the previous section, and
$P(r)$ and $\epsilon(r)$ are determined by the equation of state.
The equation is then fully specified and can be solved for the allowed
values of $\omega^2$.

In practice, this is done using a \emph{shooting method}.
We start by choosing a trial value of $\omega^2$ and integrate the
differential equation outward from the center using the regularity
condition $U(r)\propto r^3$ near $r=0$.
The integration proceeds until the surface $r=R$ is reached, where the
Lagrangian pressure perturbation must vanish, $\Delta P(R)=0$.
For most trial values, this condition will not be met exactly:
the solution either diverges or crosses zero an incorrect number of
times.

To find the correct eigenvalue, $\omega^2$ is adjusted and the
integration is repeated.
The number of nodes (zero crossings) of $U(r)$ provides a useful guide:
the fundamental mode has no internal nodes, the first overtone has one
node, and so on.
By searching for the value of $\omega^2$ that produces the correct
number of nodes and satisfies the surface condition, we obtain the
eigenvalue of that mode.
This process is repeated for several stellar models with different
central pressures $P_c$.

In the implementation used here, the coefficients
$\Pi(r)$, $Q(r)$, and $W(r)$ are evaluated numerically from the TOV
profiles, and the equation is integrated using a finite--difference
scheme with adaptive step size.
A bisection search is used to locate the eigenvalue $\omega^2$ to the
desired accuracy.
The full algorithm is based on the code developed by
Sletmoen~\cite{sletmoen2022}, which follows Tooper’s formulation and has
been adapted here to analyze the stability of the ideal neutron star
sequence.

\subsection{Results and stability criterion}

The numerical integration of Eq.~\eqref{eq:SL_ideal_NS} provides the
eigenvalues $\omega^2$ and eigenfunctions $U(r)$ for each stellar model
in the sequence.
The sign of the lowest eigenvalue $\omega_0^2$ determines whether the
configuration is stable or unstable:
\[
\omega_0^2 > 0 \;\Rightarrow\; \text{stable}, \qquad
\omega_0^2 = 0 \;\Rightarrow\; \text{marginally stable}, \qquad
\omega_0^2 < 0 \;\Rightarrow\; \text{unstable}.
\]
In practice, we find that $\omega_0^2$ decreases with increasing central
pressure $P_c$ and becomes zero exactly at the maximum of the
mass--radius curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:mr_neutron}.
This confirms the general stability criterion for relativistic stars:
configurations on the rising branch of the mass curve
($dM/dP_c>0$) are dynamically stable, while those beyond the turning
point ($dM/dP_c<0$) are unstable to radial collapse.
The maximum therefore marks the \emph{Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit},
beyond which no static equilibrium exists.

The corresponding eigenfunctions show the expected behaviour:
the fundamental mode $U_0(r)$ has no interior nodes, and higher modes
($U_1$, $U_2$, \ldots) have one, two, and more zero crossings,
respectively.
Each eigenfunction remains finite at the center and satisfies the
surface condition $\Delta P(R)=0$, confirming that the numerical
integration is well behaved.

To check the robustness of the results, we verified the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The node theorem holds: the number of interior zeros of $U(r)$
  matches the mode index $n$.
  \item The eigenvalues $\omega_n^2$ converge under grid refinement and
  are insensitive to small changes in the inner and outer integration
  limits.
  \item The zero crossing of $\omega_0^2$ coincides with the maximum
  mass obtained directly from the TOV sequence, within numerical
  precision.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  %\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/omega2_vs_Pc.pdf}
  \caption[Fundamental mode and stability]
  {Fundamental squared frequency $\omega_0^2$ versus central pressure

   onset of instability and coincides with the maximum mass in
   Fig.~\ref{fig:mr_neutron}.}
  \label{fig:omega2_vs_Pc}
\end{figure}

Overall, the stability analysis demonstrates that the relativistic
ideal neutron star behaves as expected: small perturbations lead to
stable oscillations below the Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit, while models
beyond the maximum mass are unstable and collapse under their own
gravity.

\subsection*{Discussion}

These results illustrate how the inclusion of relativistic gravity and a
realistic Fermi gas EOS naturally produces a maximum stable mass for
neutron stars.  The simple ideal neutron model predicts
$M_{\mathrm{max}}\!\sim\!0.7\,M_{\odot}$, smaller than observed neutron
star masses ($\sim\!1.4\,M_{\odot}$).  The discrepancy arises because
the ideal model neglects nuclear interactions, composition gradients,
and phase transitions that stiffen the EOS at high densities.  Still,
the ideal neutron star captures the essential qualitative behavior:
relativity imposes an upper bound on stable mass, just as the analytic
incompressible solution hinted through the Buchdahl bound.  The
Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit is therefore the realistic manifestation of
that same gravitational instability in a physical neutron matter EOS.
