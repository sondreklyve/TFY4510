\chapter{Ideal Neutron Stars}
\label{chap:ideal_neutron_stars}

\section{Introduction}

The concept of an \emph{ideal neutron star} provides a minimal
theoretical model for a relativistic compact star.
In this picture the stellar interior is assumed to consist solely
of neutrons, treated as a cold, non--interacting Fermi gas.
This construction parallels the classic white dwarf model,
where support against gravity is provided by the electron degeneracy
pressure. The key distinction is that neutron stars reach densities
so high that the gravitational field itself is extremely strong,
requiring a treatment within general relativity.
The appropriate framework is therefore given by the TOV equations
introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:tov}.

To close the TOV system, an EOS relating pressure $P$ and energy density
$\epsilon$ must be specified.
Here we adopt the ideal Fermi gas EOS developed in
Chapter~\ref{chap:fermi}, specialized to neutrons of mass $m_{n}$.
Substituting this EOS into the TOV equations yields a complete system
that can be solved numerically.

The aim of this chapter is therefore to construct and analyze such ideal neutron
star models, with the focus on the numerical implementation and results.

\section{Numerical Setup}

The TOV equations derived in Chapter~\ref{chap:tov} describe the
radial dependence of the pressure $P(r)$ and enclosed mass $m(r)$ in a
static, spherically symmetric star. To integrate these equations we
must specify the boundary conditions. They are
\[
m(0)=0, \qquad P(0)=P_c, \qquad P(R)=0,
\]
where $P_c$ is the central pressure and $R$ is the stellar radius at
which the pressure vanishes. The corresponding gravitational mass is
then $M=m(R)$.

In Chapter~\ref{chap:fermi} we obtained this relation for a degenerate,
zero--temperature Fermi gas. Specializing to neutrons of mass $m_N$,
the EOS can be expressed in parametric form
\[
P = P(x_F), \qquad \epsilon = \epsilon(x_F),
\]
with $x_F=p_F/m_N$ the dimensionless Fermi momentum.
Although this parametric representation is convenient analytically,
the numerical solver expects $\epsilon(P)$. We therefore invert
$P(x_F)$ numerically to obtain $x_F(P)$, and then evaluate
$\epsilon(x_F)$ accordingly. This guarantees a consistent mapping
between $P$ and $\epsilon$ across all density regimes.

For numerical stability it is advantageous to work with dimensionless
variables. We introduce reference scales for radius, mass, and energy
density,
\[
r_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G \epsilon_0}}, \qquad
m_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G^3 \epsilon_0}}, \qquad
\epsilon_0 = m_N^4.
\]
All quantities are then expressed in units of $(r_0, m_0, \epsilon_0)$,
so that
\[
\hat r = r/r_0, \qquad
\hat m = m/m_0, \qquad
\hat P = P/\epsilon_0, \qquad
\hat \epsilon = \epsilon/\epsilon_0.
\]
In terms of these variables the TOV system takes a dimensionless form
suitable for numerical integration. This rescaling avoids very large
or small floating--point numbers and improves the stability of the
Runge--Kutta solver.

In summary, the numerical setup consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The TOV equations, integrated outward from the center with 
  initial conditions $m(0)=0$ and $P(0)=P_c$, and terminated when 
  the surface condition $P(R)=0$ is reached. The corresponding 
  radius $R$ and gravitational mass $M=m(R)$ then characterize 
  the stellar model.
  \item The ideal neutron gas EOS $\epsilon(P)$, obtained from the
  parametric Fermi gas expressions of Chapter~\ref{chap:fermi}.
  \item Dimensionless variables to reduce numerical instabilities.
\end{enumerate}
Together these ingredients define a well--posed system suitable for
numerical solution.

\section{Numerical Method}

The numerical integration of the TOV equations with the ideal neutron
gas EOS is carried out using a Python program originally developed by
Sletmoen as part of his Master's thesis~\cite{sletmoen2022}.
In this work the code is used without modification to generate stellar
models for the case of ideal neutron matter.

The implementation proceeds as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The coupled ODEs for $P(r)$ and $m(r)$ are integrated outward
  from $r=0$ with initial values $P(0)=P_c$ and $m(0)=0$.
  \item A Runge--Kutta algorithm with adaptive step size is used to
  advance the solution.
  \item The integration terminates once $P(r)$ vanishes, which defines
  the stellar radius $R$. The corresponding $m(R)$ gives the
  gravitational mass $M$.
\end{itemize}
Repeating the calculation for a range of central pressures $P_c$
generates a sequence of stellar configurations. From these solutions
one can extract the global properties of the star --- quantities defined
at the surface that characterize the star as a whole --- namely its mass
$M=m(R)$ and radius $R$ where $P(R)=0$. These global results can then be
combined into the mass--radius relation. In addition, the solver also
provides access to the internal structure, meaning the radial profiles
of pressure $P(r)$ and energy density $\epsilon(r)$ throughout the
stellar interior. Such internal results reveal how matter is distributed
and how pressure balances gravity at each radius, complementing the
global description. In the following section we present both global and
internal results for ideal neutron stars.


\section{Results}

The numerical integration of the TOV equations using the ideal neutron
gas EOS yields both global properties, such as the mass--radius relation,
and internal structure, such as the pressure distribution.
These results can be directly compared with the analytic behavior found
for the uniform--density star in Chapter~\ref{chap:tov}.

\subsection*{Mass--radius relation}

Figure~\ref{fig:mr_neutron} shows the resulting mass--radius curves for
ideal neutron stars.  The four models represent combinations of
Newtonian and relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium with either the
non--relativistic or the full relativistic form of the Fermi gas EOS.
Each point corresponds to a distinct central pressure $P_c$.

At low central pressures the models coincide, reflecting the Newtonian
limit where gravitational fields are weak and the EOS is nearly
non--relativistic.  As $P_c$ increases, however, the relativistic models
deviate markedly: the curves flatten and eventually exhibit a turnover,
indicating that beyond a certain maximum mass, no further stable
solutions exist.  This behavior is the relativistic analogue of the
instability already anticipated from the incompressible model, where the
pressure diverges at the Buchdahl bound $2M/R=8/9$.  In the realistic
neutron gas, the same effect manifests as the \emph{Oppenheimer--Volkoff
limit}~\cite{oppenheimer1939}: a maximum gravitational mass of order
$M_{\mathrm{max}}\!\approx\!0.7\,M_{\odot}$ for an ideal, non--interacting
neutron fluid.  Beyond this point, increasing the central pressure only
reduces the radius without adding mass, and the configuration becomes
unstable to collapse.

The Newtonian solutions, in contrast, show no turnover.  They predict
monotonically increasing mass with increasing central pressure, an
artifact of neglecting relativistic corrections to both gravity and the
EOS.  The fully relativistic treatment thus captures a key qualitative
feature: the existence of a maximum stable mass set by the balance
between degeneracy pressure and spacetime curvature.

  indicates the central pressure $P_c$.  The relativistic models exhibit a
  maximum mass, the Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit, beyond which no static
  equilibrium is possible.}

\subsection*{Pressure profiles}

Figure~\ref{fig:profiles_neutron} displays the normalized pressure
profiles $P(r)/P_c$ for a range of central pressures.
For small $P_c$, the pressure decreases almost linearly with radius,
resembling the Newtonian incompressible case.
As $P_c$ increases, the curves become increasingly concentrated toward
the center, revealing stronger gravitational compression and greater
compactness.  The outer layers contribute less to the total mass, while
the interior supports an ever larger fraction of the gravitational
weight.  This mirrors the analytic results for the constant--density
star, where high compactness led to steep gradients and eventual
divergence at the Buchdahl bound.

At the highest central pressures, the pressure gradient near the center
becomes extremely steep, signaling the proximity of the
Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit.  Beyond this limit, no equilibrium solution
exists: the star must collapse into a black hole.  Thus, the numerical
pressure profiles confirm the same qualitative physics inferred from the
analytic model—namely, that gravity strengthens faster than the pressure
support as compactness increases.

  a stronger concentration of pressure toward the center, consistent with
  the approach to the Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit.}

\subsection*{Discussion}

These results illustrate how the inclusion of relativistic gravity and a
realistic Fermi gas EOS naturally produces a maximum stable mass for
neutron stars.  The simple ideal neutron model predicts
$M_{\mathrm{max}}\!\sim\!0.7\,M_{\odot}$, smaller than observed neutron
star masses ($\sim\!1.4\,M_{\odot}$).  The discrepancy arises because
the ideal model neglects nuclear interactions, composition gradients,
and phase transitions that stiffen the EOS at high densities.  Still,
the ideal neutron star captures the essential qualitative behavior:
relativity imposes an upper bound on stable mass, just as the analytic
incompressible solution hinted through the Buchdahl bound.  The
Oppenheimer--Volkoff limit is therefore the realistic manifestation of
that same gravitational instability in a physical neutron matter EOS.
