Neutron stars contain matter at extremely high densities, where both general relativity and
quantum many-body physics are required to describe their structure. In this project, we study
how different models of dense matter affect the relation between the mass and radius of a
neutron star. The analysis is based on the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations, which are solved
numerically for various equations of state.

We first consider a simple model, namely an ideal, non-interacting Fermi gas. This illustrates how
degeneracy pressure can counteract gravitational collapse, while also demonstrating the limitations
of such idealised descriptions when confronted with observed neutron-star properties.
Building on this, the main part of the project develops an interacting model for nucleons and
leptons in equilibrium. The interactions are described through self-consistent meson fields,
leading to a more realistic equation of state, which is combined with a standard crust
model before being used in the numerical stellar calculations.

The resulting mass–radius relations yield radii typical of neutron stars,
but they do not support the heaviest observed stars and show clear differences from current
astronomical constraints. This demonstrates that while the interacting model improves upon the
ideal, non-interacting Fermi gas description, it remains incomplete at the highest densities.

Overall, the project presents a coherent path from ideal models to a description of interacting
dense matter and shows the need for more advanced equations of state in order to reproduce
the full range of observed neutron-star properties.
